An IME tool for Malayalam language.

# History of the birth of this program.
3 Months ago, I bought my new laptop with Windows 11. Since all my works are related to Malayalam language, I hardly need an IME tool.
KeyMagic was my favorite tool in Windows 10. But KeyMagic is not working in Windows 11 for some unknown reason. So I have decided to use InKey. It is created with the famous scripting language AutoHoyKey. But there are some differences in KeyMagic's keymap and InKey's keymap. The keymap I am using with KeyMagic is designed by me. So I want to change the keymap of InKey. But it felt really difficult. So I gave up the idea and decided to write my own IME tool for Windows 11. And in a shiny evening of 2022 Jun'es last week, I have started coding this program in my favorite programming language D. Actually, it is not completed yet because of my laziness. However, we can use to type Malayalam language.
